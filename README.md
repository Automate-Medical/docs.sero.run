# Overview

## Sero is a toolkit for devs building in health

* 🏍️ **Launch with SMART on FHIR or CDS Hooks fast.** The fastest way to build CDS Hooks Services for decision support APIs and SMART Apps for both practitioners and patients.
* 🔥 **Work with JS/TS.** Create and consume FHIR \(and friends\) data sources, protocols, and APIs with end-to-end TypeScript or ES2015 JavaScript. Minimal production dependencies and good defaults \(native modules, Fastify, ajv\).
* 😎 **Easy local env.** Run a local FHIR server for development with no additional dependencies. Put your Synthea output in a folder and it's instantly available as a local FHIR R4 REST API.
* 📖 **Open source.** Apache License 2.0.

## Where you should go next

{% hint style="info" %}
Understanding health APIs can be hard. **We've written a guide for building in health care the easy way.**
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="decision-support/how-to-build/" %}

You can find information on FHIR, SMART Apps, CDS Hooks, Patient Access APIs, Provider Directories, and much more. In the process of building Automate Medical, we had to bootstrap this guide ourselves. We're sharing it publicly so that more builders and innovators can follow.
