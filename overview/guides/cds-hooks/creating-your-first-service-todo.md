# Creating Your First Service

## Download starter code \(optional\)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `cds-hooks-api-guide` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
git clone (url-in-progress)
```

## What you'll be building

In this section of the walkthrough, you'll be building your first CDS service. This service is pretty simple: it'll mirror the current time back to the client that made the request. 

## The code

### Imports  

In the `src` directory, create a folder called `current-time`. `cd` into it and create the file `get-current-time.js`. Sero includes a `Service` class and a `Card` class. Import those at the top of the file:

```javascript
import { Service, Card } from "@sero.run/sero";
```

### Options

Every CDS service consists of two things: a **configurations option object**, and a **service handler**. The options object contains necessary and optional parameters for setting up a CDS service. 

Your service will respond to the `patient-view` hook. In other words, a workflow in which the user of the CDS client opens a patients medical record. 

Every service you make for your CDS Hooks API can be called by a CDS client making requests to `<server_url>/cds-services`. The `id` parameter is the unique identifier for a service, and the description is a human-readable explanation of what the service does. Sero configures this for you - it is required in the CDS Hooks specification. 

```javascript
const options = {
  id: "get-current-time",
  title: "Get the current time",
  hook: "patient-view",
  description:
    "This example shows how easy it is to make a CDS hooks service with Sero. This service responds with the current time after being invoked by the patient-view hook",
};

```

### Service handler

The service handler is an `async` function that runs when an HTTP `request` is made to a service on your server \(in this case, `<server_url>/cds-services/get-current-time`\).  

```javascript
const handler = async (request) => {
    ...
};
```

Upon receiving a request, the handler can respond with a new `Card` displaying the current time. 

```javascript
const handler = async (request) => {
  const today = new Date();
  const minutes = today.getUTCMinutes();
  const time = `${today.getHours()}:${
    minutes <= 9 ? "0" : ""
  }${minutes}:${today.getSeconds()}`;
  return {
    cards: [
      new Card({
        source: {
          label: "Automate Medical, Inc.",
          url: "https://www.automatemedical.com/",
        },
        summary: `What time is it?`,
        detail: `The current time is ${time}`,
        indicator: "info",
      }),
    ],
  };
};
```

Lastly, instantiate the service and export it.

```javascript
export default new Service(options, handler);
```

## Deployment

### Calling the API

For this part of the walkthrough, you'll be using the [CDS Hooks sandbox](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/) to make requests to your server. 

Run your server with `npm run start`. Although your server is running locally, you are unable to make requests to it because it is not connected to the internet. You are going to use a tunneling service - namely, ngrok, to generate a public URL for your server so it can be seen by CDS clients designed to test your application.

### Configuring ngrok

First either [log in or create an account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/login) with ngrok. Next, go [through the short walkthrough](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) that guides you through basic installation and authentication. Launch ngrok and, with the server running, enter `ngrok http 0.0.0.0:8080`. Your screen should now provide a public `http` and `https` links for your server.

### Launching the CDS sandbox

Head to the [CDS-sandbox](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/). You should see the following screen.

![CDS sandbox dashboard](../../../.gitbook/assets/cds-sandbox.png)

By default, the sandbox shows a default response to a `patient-view` hook invocation that returns a card with the text **Now seeing: Daniel.** 

Click on the gear in the top right and, in the dropdown, select "Add CDS Services." Paste the public link from ngrok into the input area. Append `/cds-services` to the end of the link, and click "Save."

You should now see the following screen.

![CDS sandbox displaying the result of both patient-view hooks](../../../.gitbook/assets/exaple_1_result.png)

The sandbox is now aware of two `patient-view` hooks: the hook that was there by default, and the hook you created. You should see two cards on the left, with one of the cards displaying the current time in 24-hour format.

Congratulations! You just built a CDS API and created your first service. In the next section you'll learn more about CDS Hooks, how to deal with incoming requests, and how to work with FHIR data.
