description: Making a CDS service with Sero
---

# Creating Your First Service \(TODO\)

## Download starter code \(optional\)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `cds-hooks-api-guide` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
git clone (sero-example-repo-url-here)
```

With this step we are also going to use Sero to make our first API, and make a request to it with the CDS Hooks sandbox. This models a CDS client. 

## Our first service

In the `src` directory, create a folder called `current-time` and make two files inside: `get-current-time.js`. 

Sero includes a `Service` class and a `Card` class. 

## CDS clients, and tunneling to our service

## Deployment

You can deploy the API to the internet, or a service like heroku or fly. With this tutorial, we are going to get the server up and running with ngrok.
