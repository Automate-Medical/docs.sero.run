# Creating Your First Service \(TODO\)

## Download starter code \(optional\)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `cds-hooks-api-guide` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
git clone (sero-example-repo-url-here)
```

## More on services

Hopefully you saw \(this section\) already, but we are going to be creating our first service! With this step we are also going to use Sero to make our first API, and make a request to it with the CDS Hooks sandbox. This models a CDS client. 

## Our first service - mirror the current time

This is what it is going to do

Make a folder called `current-time` and make two files inside: `get-current-time.ts` and `index.ts`. These files are for building our service and. 

## Deployment

You can deploy the API to the internet, or a service like heroku or fly. With this tutorial, we are going to get the server up and running with ngrok.
