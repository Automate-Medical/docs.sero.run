description: Exchanging FHIR data with Sero
---

# Prefetch and Context \(TODO\)

## Download starter code \(optional\)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `cds-hooks-api-guide` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
git clone (sero-example-repo-url-here)
```

## Getting FHIR data

We're now ready to use Sero to work with FHIR data.
