# Creating Our First Service

## What we'll be building

This Service is pretty simple: it will tell us the current time. More specifically, it will echo the current time back to the Client that makes a request for decision support.

{% endhint %}

## The code

### Imports  

In the `src` directory, create a folder called `current-time` then `cd` into it and create the file `get-current-time.js`.

Sero includes a `Service` class and a `Card` class. Import those at the top of the file:

{% code title="get-current-time.js" %}
```javascript
import { Service, Card } from "@sero.run/sero";
```
{% endcode %}

### Options

Every CDS service consists of two things: a **configurations option object**, and a **service handler**. The options object contains necessary and optional parameters for creating a CDS Service. 

Let's define the following options:

{% code title="get-current-time.js" %}
```javascript
const options = {
  id: "get-current-time",
  title: "Get the current time",
  hook: "patient-view",
  description: "This example shows how easy it is to make a CDS hooks service with Sero. This service responds with the current time after being invoked by the patient-view hook",
};
```
{% endcode %}

What do these options mean?

Every service that's made on our CDS Hooks API can be called by a CDS client making requests to `<server_url>/cds-services`. The `id` parameter is the unique identifier for a service. 

The title and description are a human-readable name and explanation of what the service does. They are required.

Lastly, this service will respond to the `patient-view` **Hook**. This is used to tell the a CDS client when to use this decision support \(in this case, when a patient record is being view\). Hooks also help us define data requirements, which we will cover in a later section.

Luckily, Sero configures this automatically for us.

### Service handler

The Service handler is an `async` function that runs when a request is made from a Client to a Service. In this case, an HTTP GET request is sent to`/cds-services/get-current-time`.  The `id` we defined in the options above is what configures this url.

Let's add an empty handler to `get-current-time.js`

{% code title="get-current-time.js" %}
```javascript
const handler = async (request) => { };
```
{% endcode %}

Upon receiving a request, the handler will respond with a new `Card` displaying the current time. Let's expand our handler:

{% code title="get-current-time.js" %}
```javascript
const handler = async (request) => {
  const today = new Date();
  const minutes = today.getUTCMinutes();
  const time = `${today.getHours()}:${
    minutes <= 9 ? "0" : ""
  }${minutes}:${today.getSeconds()}`;
  return {
    cards: [
      new Card({
        source: {
          label: "Automate Medical, Inc.",
          url: "https://www.automatemedical.com/",
        },
        summary: `What time is it?`,
        detail: `The current time is ${time}`,
        indicator: "info",
      }),
    ],
  };
};
```
{% endcode %}

Our handler now returns an object with a new `Card` containing information about the current time. Not exactly ground-breaking decision support, but we need to start somewhere!

Finally, let's add a default export:

{% code title="get-current-time.js" %}
```javascript
export default new Service(options, handler);
```
{% endcode %}

## Testing

### Calling our API

For this part of the walkthrough, we'll be using the [**CDS Hooks sandbox**](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/) ****to make requests to our server. 

Run the server with `npm run start`. Although the server is running locally, we are unable to make requests to it because it is not connected to the internet. You are going to use a tunneling service - namely ngrok, to generate a public URL for the server so it can be seen by CDS clients to test our newly-created API.

### Configuring ngrok

First, create an [account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/login) with ngrok. Go [through the short walkthrough](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) that guides through basic installation and authentication. Launch ngrok and, with the server running, enter `ngrok http 0.0.0.0:8080`. The console should now provide a public `http` and `https` links for the server.

### Launching the CDS Hooks Sandbox

Head to the [**CDS Hooks Sandbox**](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/). The sandbox simulates three example workflows and let's us test the Service as a Client.

You should see the Patient View workflow on your screen. On the left, we see a simulated EHR event \(viewing a patient record\). On the right, we see a debug panel showing the request/response lifecycle from the Service.

![CDS Hooks Sandbox Patient View](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-08-12-at-1.49.28-pm.png)

By default, the sandbox shows a default response to a `patient-view` hook invocation that returns a card with the text **Now seeing: Daniel.** You can see the Card rendering this information on the left.

Click on the gear in the top right and, in the dropdown, select "_Add CDS Services_."

Paste the public `https` link from ngrok into the input area. Append `/cds-services` to the end of the link, and click "_Save_." This is known as the "Discovery Endpoint" for our Service.

The CDS Hooks Sandbox will ask Sero for a list of Services in our Discovery Endpoint.

![CDS Hooks Sandbox displaying the result of our new decision support Service](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-08-12-at-1.57.25-pm.png)

Our new Service, `get-current-time` returns a Card, now displayed on the left, with the current time.

Congratulations! We just built a CDS API with a simple CDS service. In the next section we'll learn more about CDS Hooks, how to deal with incoming requests, and how to work with FHIR Resources.
