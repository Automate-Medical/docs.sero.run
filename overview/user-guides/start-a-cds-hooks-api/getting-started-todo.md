# Getting Started \(TODO\)

To implement a CDS hooks API from scratch, there are a lot of things you should know:

* You need to conform to the specification
* You need to dig deep into the documentation
* You need to take care of integrating new changes when the specification changes

All of this is possible but leads to a bad developer experience.

## What we'll be building

Going over the example...going to be making three hooks, one of which is pretty involved, another which is going to ask the implementer to do it almost all by themselves.

We are a doctor and we first view a record. We get a suggestion that this patient has not made an appointment in a while. The suggestion is to make a new appointment, and the link is for the SMART app to book the appointment. 

Later we have a hook for the encounter, which will help us make 

We'll be building this step by step, intdocucing concepts of CDS hooks and then explaining how Sero helps you with them...
