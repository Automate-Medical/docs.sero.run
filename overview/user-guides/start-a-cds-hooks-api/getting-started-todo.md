# Getting Started \(TODO\)

This section is going to explain what life would be like without Sero ðŸ˜­ \(list of what it was like for me \[@mason\] to get started learning CDS hooks\). 

Some tools make it easy, but the development experience isn't great. Thus we made sero. 

## Introducing Sero - The Typescript Toolchain for CDS Hooks

Explain why Sero makes developing a CDS hooks API so great...

## What we'll be building

Going over the example...going to be making three hooks, one of which is pretty involved, another which is going to ask the implementer to do it almost all by themselves.

We are a doctor and we first view a record. We get a suggestion that this patient has not made an appointment in a while. The suggestion is to make a new appointment, and the link is for the SMART app to book the appointment. 

Later we have a hook for the encounter, which will help us make 

We'll be building this step by step, intdocucing concepts of CDS hooks and then explaining how Sero helps you with them...
