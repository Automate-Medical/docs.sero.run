# Provider Directory

## What is a provider directory?

{% hint style="success" %}
**Provider directory access is a supported feature in Sero, contact fou**[**nders@automatemedical.com** ](mailto:founders@automatemedical.com)\*\*\*\*
{% endhint %}

Provider directories are databases containing formation about insurance plans, practitioners \(like doctors and specialists\) and their roles \(the specific services offered\).

> Provider directories play a critical role in enabling identification of individual providers and provider organizations, as well as characteristics about them. Provider directories support a variety of use cases.

Provider directories help to answer questions about:

* Finding specialist service providers for specific medical services
* Which providers, primary care doctors, specialists, pharmacies, facilities are "in network" for a given plan
* Accessibility and scheduling information, office hours, spoken languages
* Organizations that provide health care services, available insurance plans, coverage locations

### How do provider directories work?

In the United States, CMS regulated health plans are required to publish a public-facing [**FHIR API**](fhir/). Major plan payors/administrators like Humana, Aetna, and Optum 



\*\*\*\*



Under the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule and the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization final rule, Medicaid FFS programs, CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities are required to make provider directory information available via the Provider Directory API. The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule includes MA organizations. This API must be accessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on the payerâ€™s website. The IG is the HL7 FHIR Da Vinci PDex Plan Net IG: Version STU 1.0.0.
