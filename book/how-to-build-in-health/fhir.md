## What is FHIR [üî•](https://emojipedia.org/fire/)?

{% hint style="success" %}
**FHIR \(Fast healthcare Interoperability Resources\) has many meanings. Here are a few that might help.**
{% endhint %}

‚úîÔ∏è FHIR is a community health information systems standards project and is the [registered trademark of HL7](http://www.hl7.org/index.cfm)

‚úîÔ∏è FHIR is an API \(REST\) standard for health data

‚úîÔ∏è FHIR is a structured document format \(JSON/XML\) for health data

‚úîÔ∏è FHIR is an ONC/CMS ruled transport mechanism for health data

‚úîÔ∏è FHIR is an entry point for patient access, provider directories, formulary APIs, and more

## FHIR is an API + document schema

REST APIs are familiar to developers. FHIR is, in part, a RESTful API over ~150 Resources \(classes, entities, objects, tables, types\). Each Resource has GET, POST, PATCH, etc HTTP operations. Base Resources can be constrained or extended with Profiles that are a kind of a document schema. Documents are formatted as JSON and XML.

{% hint style="success" %}
It's easy to use a FHIR API because it's just REST!
