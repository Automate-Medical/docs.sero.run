# Patient Access

## What is patient access?

{% hint style="success" %}
There are ways for patients to access their data through APIs. Today, nearly 100 million US patients can share their data with application developers. ****[**Automate Medical**](https://www.automatemedical.com/), ****authors of the Sero toolkit, ****can help you get access.
{% endhint %}

Patient access is all about the ability for patients to access their own health data. As electronic health records have evolved, so too have the ways and means for patients to access them.

Today, there are new patient access standards that enable app developers and startups to build experiences around patient health records without needing to seek the permission of anyone but the patient. For nearly 100 million US patients, it's newly possible to build applications that:

* Synchronize health records into a "local wallet" on a phone
* Example 2 app
* Example 3 app

This is possible because the [21st Century Cures Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Cures_Act) \(2016\) and [**Interoperability and Patient Access final rule** \(CMS-9115-F\)](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index) ****set the foundation for adoption of an open patient access framework.

The Patient Access final rule specifically mandates the use of FHIR, SMART, and USCDI \(technical standards we will discuss below\) by CMS-contract payers like Humana, Aetna, and Optum. **As of July 1, 2021, we are now in the enforcement period for having Patient Access APIs** available:

> As of July 1, 2021, two of the policies from the May 2020 Interoperability and Patient Access final rule are now in effect... On July 1, 2021, CMS began to enforce requirements for certain payers to support Patient Access

### Opportunity

As a result of 

* ~100 million beneficiares in CMS programs, and growing - all of these patients have the ability to allow you to access their health data from their plan administrator \("payer"\)
* Uses an authorization and identity model familiar to developers \(the SMART Authorization 
* Lots of in the wild examples
* Permissionless
* 
### Technical Standards

We will cover , but at a high level

 CARIN BB 

* [FHIR](fhir.md#what-is-fhir)
* [SMART/OAuth 2.0](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/)
* [United States Core Data for Interoperability \(USCDI\)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi)

### Challenges

## How does patient acccess work?

* CARIN BB 2.0
* Payer data
